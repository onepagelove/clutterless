## Frequently Asked Questions

### How can a blog be a One Page WordPress theme?
- There are no pages or posts, the theme is designed to be an uninterrupted reading experience starting from the newest posts. 

### What about SEO? How do search bots crawl the site?
- All the titles in the archives link to the post which allow a crawl and index. Also direct links are there to share, no problem, see [this page link]().

### I canâ€™t code at all, how much can I change on the theme?
- The theme utilizes WordPressâ€™s Theme Customizer (see screenshot). You can change text color, link color, sidebar color, browser background color and lots more.

### How is Clutterless v2 different from v1
1. Removed most of the AJAX wizardry (except loading archives), it didn't play nice with plugins and felt more gimicky than useful. 
2. Stripped out a few things to simplify it to One Page first theme (simply read and load more posts at bottom), it can be turned into a standard blog when tweaking a few theme settings within the Customizer.
3. A new set of fonts.
4. Better options like font switching within the Customizer (coming soon)
5. Improved code in every way.
